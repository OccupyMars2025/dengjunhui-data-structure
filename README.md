## 2023/12/4 - 12/22: (failure)first round, ignore many details, you are not able to implement those algorithms independently
## 2023/12/27 - 2024/1/10: second round, figure out every detail, able to implement all algorithms independently, complete all exercises independently

- [ ] make it running on Linux with gcc
